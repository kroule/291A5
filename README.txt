Instructions:
	1). Make sure to have the "YVR_Airbnb_listings_summary.csv" and "YVR_Airbnb_reviews.csv" data in the same directory as the python files.
	2). Run A5T1.py and A5T2.py. This will create the databases
	3). Run the remaining python files as needed in any order.
		3a). For Tasks 5 - Input a neighborhood to see average price (e.g: "Sunset" or "Downtown")
		3b). For Task 8 - Input a single listing_id (e.g: 10080) Assuming input is known to exist - no error for non-existant printed out.
		3c). For Task 9 - input a set of keywords separated by commas and once space. (e.g: "great, fantastic, horrible" )

Notes:	1). Our python code for MongoClient uses port 27017
	2). A5T2 takes a while to work (It's not frozen)
