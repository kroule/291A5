A single .tgz file containing a README.txt file, and all necessary (and commented) source code in Python necessary to execute the necessary applications (the naming of all files must be as described above). The README file should have the name(s) of student(s), their ccid(s), the usual collaboration statement, a list of all included files, plus a brief instructions on how to run the applications. The README file should also include a section with a simple "how to‚Äù guide for executing the applications for each task. The .tgz file (containing at least 12 files, README.txt plus 11 .py files and other files with common functions you have defined) should be submitted using this submission page.
